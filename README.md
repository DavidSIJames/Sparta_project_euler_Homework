## Challenges

The biggest challenge faced was waiting for problem 5 to finish. The code to complete problem 5 either needs to be optimised to complete faster, or needs to be run on a faster computer.

## Takeaway

Completing problems on project Euler is a really good way to get the hang of loops, and conditional statements as every question needs them.
